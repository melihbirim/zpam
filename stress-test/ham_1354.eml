Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to remind you about our meeting tomorrow at 2 PM in the conference room.

We'll be discussing the quarterly reports and planning for next quarter.

Please let me know if you need to reschedule.

Best regards,
John Smith%!(EXTRA string=John Smith)
